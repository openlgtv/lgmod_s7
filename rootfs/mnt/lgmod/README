Notes:
	By default, lgmod is disabled. To enable it:
		cp -a /mnt/lgmod/lgmod.example /mnt/lg/user/lgmod/init/lgmod
	This is very first version
	It should work but it is tested only on LG 32LD465-ZA
	That is EU firmware! Be carefult!


Steps:
	Prepare:
		Check wiki: How to backup TV firmware
			http://openlgtv.org.ru/wiki/index.php/How_to_backup_TV_firmware
		Check wiki: Partition Editing
			http://openlgtv.org.ru/wiki/index.php/Partition_Editing
		Check wiki: Debug mode connection
			http://openlgtv.org.ru/wiki/index.php/Debug_mode_connection

	Required!
		Make a backup!
		Verify your backup!
		Double check the number of your partitions!
			(especially if it is not EU firmware!!!)
			rootfs must be number 3; lginit must be number 4

	Install
		Enter debug mode
		Press F10 for debug prompt
		Start 'sh'
			$ call 0x004d76bc+0xb0
		Erase rootfs
			# flash_eraseall /dev/mtd3
		Write rootfs
			# cat /mnt/usb1/Drive1/lgmod_S7_10001.sqfs > /dev/mtd3
		Erase lginit
			# flash_eraseall /dev/mtd4
		Write lginit
			# cat /mnt/usb1/Drive1/mtd4_lginit.sqfs > /dev/mtd4


Features:
	lgmod for S7 - as it is (all features)
		upload dir is /dev/shm/upload, limit 22M (tools.cgi is modified)
		you can do /etc/init.d/lgmod start|stop
		rc.sysinit and rc.local are in "/etc/init.d/lgmod boot"
		"rcS shutdown" is in: /etc/init.d/rcS and "/etc/init.d/lgmod shutdown"
		modules are inside /lib/modules (changes in lgmod.sh and /etc/init.d/lgmod)

	startup options: /mnt/lgmod/lgmod.example
		mount /dev/ as tmpfs
		use lginit or "lginit as sh script"
		do not start RELEASE (like it is in lgmod)
		do not start lgmod

	custom init scripts: /mnt/lgmod/lginit.example

	/dev/shm is tmpfs (33MB), skeleton from /mnt/lg/user/lgmod/init/devshm/
		(the same as /mnt/lgmod/init/lgmod/init/devshm/)


Changes:
	dev.tar.gz - from LG as is
	dev-lgmod.tar.gz - added
	just in case: chmod -R g+w,o+w /dev

	/etc/init.d/*
	/etc/fstab - LG fstab content is also there
	/etc/inittab
	/etc/mtab

	/etc/auth.sh
	/etc/lgmod.sh
	/etc/udhcpc-default.script

	/lib/modules/ (pty.ko and mini_fo.ko from rtokarev)

	/mnt/lgmod/


More notes:
	LG files in /etc/rc.d are not used
	LG binaries and links are not touched, not removed
		example: /bin/kill (14K) /bin/ps (81K), /bin/watch (144K)
			All LG binaries instead of busybox links
		example: /bin/udhcpc (50K), /bin/top (200K), and more...
			busybox links are in /sbin, /usr/bin/, /usr/sbin
	Mostly, all files are preserved - as it is in LG firmware
		(without file permissions)
